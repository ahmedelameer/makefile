The man goes to the eastern end of the island and, using his axe, chops down several trees, which he uses to climb down the cliffs. He then floats away clinging to a log, using a stick and the string and fishhook he has with him to catch food. He uses his handy portable desalination kit to obtain potable water, and the AK-47 to fend off sharks. After several days of drifting, he uses his waterproof flashlight to signal a passing ship, and is rescued.
